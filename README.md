# python_crash_course
Python source from Python Crash Course 2nd edition

The purpose of this repository is to save all my work as I work through examples in the book. 
It will also serve as a notebook of sorts where I can put code examples with comments that I 
can use later on in projects.  While you can find the "official" answers online for this book,
these results are my own idea on how to best solve it, and I may end up using features such as
loops before they are actually introduced in the book as I am already aware of them.
